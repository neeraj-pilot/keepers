# Keepers Python Recovery Tool

A standalone Python script to recover secrets from Keepers shares without needing the web app.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- No external dependencies

## Usage

```bash
python recover.py <share1> <share2> [share3] ...
```

## Example

```bash
python recover.py 0302abc123def456... 0301789abc012def...
```

## Share Format

Shares are hex-encoded strings with the following structure:
- Byte 0: Threshold (minimum shares needed)
- Byte 1: Share index (1-255)
- Bytes 2+: Share data

## How It Works

This tool implements Shamir Secret Sharing recovery using:
- GF(256) finite field arithmetic
- Primitive polynomial: x^8 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + 1 (0x11d)
- Lagrange interpolation to recover f(0)

The implementation is compatible with shares generated by the Keepers web app.
